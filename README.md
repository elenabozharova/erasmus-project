# Erasmus projects web application

This repository is created for a university project for the subject "Project Management" at FCSE in Skopje .
The system speeds up the long procedures for applying to Erasmus+ projects.
The main idea is to allow participants to be informed about the state of their applications on time in order to fill out gaps before the deadlines.
